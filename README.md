# üèóÔ∏è  Download and Build Instructions
For a ready-to-use version, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Frimi01/Fribrowse/releases/) section.
If the release is outdated, open an issue requesting an updated build.

If you simply want the app up and running you can download all the neccasary
files already set up for you in the GitHub Releases panel. If it's outdated and
you want a updated version you can issue a issue.

## Windows:
To build the app without opening a console you can use the following command:
```bash
go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui
```
## Linux and Mac
On linux you should usually be able to build it normally with `go build` if you have gcc, gtk3 and libayatana-appindicator installed. 

For further instructions you should try to following the instructions from systray: https://github.com/getlantern/systray

MacOS is untested.

# ‚ö° How to use:

It's pretty intuitive:

- Double click executable! (or make program start at startup)
- Use the tray icon to open the page in your browser or quit
- Add folders for organizing bookmarks.
- Right-click folders/bookmarks for options.
- To add a bookmark, click add bookmark under folder, imput name and paste URL in the prompts.
- Drag and drop to rearrange.
- It will keep the last automatic backups when you open a page or stop the program. You can find them in the backup folder.
- If you are updating or want store, use or recover bookmarks.json files the intended import/export buttons works the best.
